I make the web a more interactive and exciting place by creating applications for the modern world. I'm currently working with [trecker.com](https://trecker.com) in Berlin, Germany, helping to digitize agriculture through innovative SaaS solutions. Before this, I worked in Montreal, Qu√©bec with [Automotive Data Solutions](https://www.adsdata.ca/), creating best in class web applications for the automotive sector.
