I'm currently working with [trecker.com](https://trecker.com) in Berlin, Germany, helping to digitize agriculture through innovative SaaS solutions.

Before moving to Berlin, I worked with [Automotive Data Solutions](https://www.adsdata.ca/) in Montreal, Qu√©bec for two years, creating best-in-class web applications for the automotive sector.
