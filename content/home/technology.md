<dl>
  <dt>React</dt>
  <dd>I have been using react now for over three years, and have developed countless single paged apps with it.</dd>
  <dt>Redux</dt>
  <dd>I like the functional style of redux, and the flexibility that it brings. However, I'm looking forward to working directly with the new [context api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>I prefer working with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) but I'm also happy working with SASS or LESS</dd>
